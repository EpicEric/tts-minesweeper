Tabletop Simulator modding script written in JavaScript for generating JSON files of Minesweeper games.

-------------------------------------------

This script generates a Minesweeper board in JavaScript using a 1-dimensional array (to place mines) and a 2-dimensional array to represent the board, and then uses Tabletop Simulator's JSON file format to automatically set up the objects correctly.

Previous versions of this script included executables written in C (for Windows) and Swift (for OS X). Now, it doesn't require any extra downloads other than the save file.

For instructions on how to use it, please refer to the Workshop page: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=405119224

This is just an amateur project, so bugs and feedback are to be expected.
