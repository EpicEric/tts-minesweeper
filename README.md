Tabletop Simulator script written in C for generating JSON files of Minesweeper games.

-------------------------------------------

This script generates a Minesweeper board in C using a matrix (board.c), and then uses Tabletop Simulator's JSON configuration to automatically set up the objects correctly (json.c).

This is just an amateur project, don't expect much from it. ;)
