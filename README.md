# tts-minesweeper
Tabletop Simulator script written in C and Swift for generating JSON files of Minesweeper games.

-------------------------------------------

This script generates a Minesweeper board in C or Swift using a matrix (board.c), and then uses Tabletop Simulator's JSON configuration to automatically set up the objects correctly (json.c).

For instructions on how to use it, refer to the Workshop page: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=405119224

This is just an amateur project, bugs are to be expected.
